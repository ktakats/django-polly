## Polly

Polly is a voting app, that allows users to create, vote, and share polls. (Still in progress).

This project is a practice project, and it's the Django version of the app that I prepared for FreeCodeCamp using Node.js (see [here](https://github.com/ktakats/Polly) and [here](https://polly-app.herokuapp.com/)).
